## "The site-specific amino acid preferences of homologous proteins depend on sequence divergence"

*****

## CODE 1: 
Scripts in this folder can be used to calculate a site-specific amino acid preference (SSAP) profile using as an input a PDB crystal structure.
In addition, scripts are provided to convert the FoldX output into a SSAP profile using the three biophysical models explained in the paper and the Supp Text.

## CODE 2:
Scripts in this folder can be used to calculate differences between site-specific preferences, and provide a quantitative measure of significance.
The scripts simulate randomized SSAP using Eq. 6 in the paper and implement the Doud et al. method for the comparison of SSAP profiles.
